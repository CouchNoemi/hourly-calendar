# hourly-calendar
## description
My motivation to do this project is learning more about javascript, experiment with different codes and improve my skills. I built this project to create a event planer this can be used to plan a busy day and organize time a quicker way. I challenged my imagination and compared the different uses of my code.
I made different color to identify it from future, past and present. it has a good interaction with the user.
My project is a web page that contains a calendar to write and save data that can be used to plan ahead of time the days.
